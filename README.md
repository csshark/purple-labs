# Purple Team Operations ðŸŸ£

### Introduction

Welcome to my Purple Team Operations repository! This is a collection of hands-on labs, simulated attacks, and defensive exercises that I've conducted as part of my journey to become a **Purple Teamer**. On the path toward obtaining <a href="https://cyberwarfare.live/product/purple-team-analyst-cpta/">CPTAv2</a>, I am trying to learn as many tools as possible and use them myself, according to the theory provided by the content of the exam preparation course. Here, you'll find detailed walkthroughs, screenshots, and insights from each lab I've performed, focusing on both *offensive* and *defensive* security practices. Here i share **my own** toughts on purple teaming while performing tests of real world scenarios and what have i learned. It is perfect place to review my journey to become specialist and great place to show off my real skills for recruiters - feel free to explore.

In today's rapidly evolving threat landscape, organizations must adopt a proactive and holistic approach to security. *Purple Teaming* is not just about testing defenses or simulating attacksâ€”it's about fostering collaboration between offensive and defensive teams to improve detection, response, and overall security posture.

### What is Purple Teaming?

**Purple Teaming** is a methodology that combines the strengths of **Red Team** and **Blue Team** to create a continuous feedback loop. While **Red Teams** focus on simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities, **Blue Teams** work on detecting and responding to those attacks. **Purple Teaming** brings these two perspectives together, enabling organizations to:

- **Test and Validate Defenses**: Simulate real-world attacks to test the effectiveness of existing security controls.
- **Improve Detection and Response**: Identify gaps in detection and response capabilities and work on improving them.
- **Foster Collaboration**: Encourage communication and collaboration between offensive and defensive teams.
- **Enhance Security Posture**: Continuously iterate and improve security measures based on lessons learned.

Purple Team is a specialist who is familiar with every path in cybersecurity industry on the same level (but could be only Mid/Senior, there is no Junior here). 

### What You'll Find Here

This repository is a personal collection of my Purple Team labs, where I simulate real-world attacks and test defensive tactics to migate threats and my cheatsheet to all topics that purple teaming is covering (Security Engineering, CyberSec Analysis, Threat Inteligence, Penetration Testing, Network Security, DevOps etc.)
